# QR Code Generator

Hello! I'm **Dheer Kedia** 👋  
In this project, I developed a simple **QR code generator** that takes a URL input from the user and generates a corresponding QR code image.

This project is built using **Node.js**, with the following npm packages:
- [`qr-image`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qr-image)
- [`inquirer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
